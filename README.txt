In our first semester we made an IoT based project whose name is 
"Smart Home Control". In this project we have controlled some electrical
appliances of the homes by our mobile phones or laptop. For this 
project we have uploaded our code on the Arduino website and controls 
our home appliances.

This project mainly consists of the following components:
1.)  Arduino UNO
2.)  BreadBoard
3.)  Infrared Sensor
4.)  DC Motor
5.)  Temperature Sensor
6.)  Some Led's

Working Of our Project: When a person enters into the house then 
                        infrared detects that person increments the 
counter. After detecting the person the Led's will automatically 
turned on. The temperature sensor detects the room temperature. If the
room temperature exceeds the threshold value then DC motor will start 
rotating and convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and starts
the fan. When the person leaves the room then another infrared sensor detects
the leaving person and decrements the counter and when there are no person
left in the house then the led's, temperature sensor, dc motor, fan etc
will automatically turned off.
