The sketch generated by Arduino IoT Cloud Thing "Smarter_Home"
https://create.arduino.cc/cloud/things/db6cc5fb-7207-4ded-b81f-1f7f31732ec7

Arduino Cloud Properties:
The following variables are automatically generated and updated when
changes are made to the Thing properties:
1.) int person_count
2.) float thing_dht
3.) bool thing_lights
4.) bool thing_fan
Properties which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have
functions which are called when their values are changed from the
Dashboard. These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the
end of this sketch.

setDebugMessageLevel(2) function allows you to obtain more information related
to the state of network and IoT cloud connection and errors the higher
number the more granular information you'll get. The default is 0 (only errors)
and the maximum is 4.
